abstract = {According to Donabedian, medical quality is determined by structure, process and outcome. In surgery, outcome is still the most frequently used indicator of surgical quality. However, there is still a lack of a precise definition of a 'good' or 'bad' surgical outcome. In 1992, it was proposed that 'negative outcome' should be subdivided into complication, failure to cure and sequelae.Complications were defined as 'any deviation from the normal postoperative course'. Conditions, which are inherent to the procedure and are expected to occur (such as pain or scar formation) should be discriminated from complications and be termed 'sequelae'. Finally, diseases that remain unchanged after surgery or reoccur (e.g. R2-resected tumour or an early recurrence of an inguinal hernia) also reflect negative outcomes, either, but constitute a failure to cure rather than a complication. The incidence of complications is still the most often used surrogate marker for surgical quality. However, we still lack a consensus on how to define and to grade surgical complications what substantially hampers the interpretation of surgical performance. A number of attempts have been made to classify surgical complications, but none of them has gained widespread acceptance. Some surgeons advocated that intuition is an appropriate guide to define what a complication might be and for grading. However, any system reporting complications must narrow the room for mistakes and subjective interpretation. Therefore, the challenge is to use a scale system, which has to be simple but must not impede accuracy or general clinical applicability. To standardize surgical outcome reporting, we have introduced a classification of surgical complications consisting of five grades. The basic principle of this classification - termed Clavien-Dindo Classification - is based on the therapy needed to treat the complication. The classification mainly focuses on the medical perspective, with major emphasis on the risk and invasiveness of the therapy used to correct a complication},

abstract = {Previous literature has attributed the use of certain antibiotics to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI); however, the time from administration to CDI onset is not adequately evaluated. We aimed to determine the type of antibiotics and duration of therapy associated with the highest CDI incidence at a tertiary academic medical center. This was a retrospective, case-control study of adult inpatients who received at least one course of antibiotic treatment. Patients were divided into either cases or controls. For cases, their first episode of CDI was a determining factor. Primary outcome were the types of antibiotics associated with risk of CDI development and the median time of antibiotic usage defining this risk. Of 601 patients who developed CDI, 313 were included as cases while 150 of 291 who received antibiotics but did not develop CDI were included as controls. Cefepime and cefazolin were significantly associated with increased risk for CDI with odds ratios of 3.01 (95{\%} CI, 1.96–4.65; P {\textless} 0.001) and 1.71 (95{\%} CI, 1.02–2.95; P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. Cefepime was associated with CDI after a median time of 8 days while CDI may have occurred after 6 days of therapy with cefazolin. Use of antineoplastic agents was significantly associated with CDI (odds ratio, 2.32; 95{\%} CI, 1.35–4.13; P {\textless} 0.01). Antibiotic use increased the risk of CDI, particularly with cefepime and cefazolin with a median time to incidence of 8 and 6 days, respectively. CDI risk was also increased with the use of antineoplastic agents.},

abstract = {Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a health care-associated infection associated with significant morbidity and cost, with highly varied risk across populations. More effective, risk-based prevention strategies are needed. Here, we investigate risk factors for hospital-associated CDI in a large integrated health system. In a retrospective cohort of all adult admissions to 21 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals from 2006 to 2012, we identified all symptomatic (i) hospital-onset and (ii) health care-facility-associated, community-onset CDI. We then evaluated the risk associated with antibiotic exposure, including that of specific agents, using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 2,356 cases of CDI among 506,068 admissions were identified (incidence, 46.6 per 10,000). Prior antibiotic use was the dominant risk factor, where for every antibiotic day of therapy prior to the index admission, the odds of subsequent CDI increased by 12.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 12.2 to 13.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.0001). This was a much stronger association than was inpatient antibiotic exposure (odds ratio [OR], 1.007 [95{\%} CI, 1.005 to 1.009]; P {\textless} 0.0001). The highest-risk antibiotics included second-generation and later cephalosporins (especially oral), carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin, while doxycycline and daptomycin were associated with a lower CDI risk. We concluded that cumulative antibiotic exposure prior to admission is the greatest contributor to the risk of subsequent CDI. Most classes of antibiotics carry some risk, which varies by drug and route. This information may be useful for antimicrobial stewardship efforts.},

abstract = {Importance: The benefits of antimicrobial prophylaxis are limited to the first 24 hours postoperatively. Little is known about the harms associated with continuing antimicrobial prophylaxis after skin closure. Objective: To characterize the association of type and duration of prophylaxis with surgical site infection (SSI), acute kidney injury (AKI), and Clostridium difficile infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multicenter, national retrospective cohort study, all patients within the national Veterans Affairs health care system who underwent cardiac, orthopedic total joint replacement, colorectal, and vascular procedures and who received planned manual review by a trained nurse reviewer for type and duration of surgical prophylaxis and for SSI from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2013, were included. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, with adjustments for covariates determined a priori to be associated with the outcomes of interest. Data were analyzed from December 2016 to December 2018. Exposures: Duration of postoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis ({\textless}24 hours, 24-{\textless}48 hours, 48-{\textless}72 hours, and ≥72 hours). Main Outcomes and Measures: Surgical site infection, AKI, and C difficile infection. Results: Of the 79058 included patients, 76109 (96.3{\%}) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 64.8 (9.4) years. Among 79058 surgical procedures in the cohort, all had SSI and C difficile outcome data available; 71344 (90.2{\%}) had AKI outcome data. After stratification by type of surgery and adjustment for age, sex, race, diabetes, smoking, American Society of Anesthesiologists score greater than 2, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization, mupirocin, type of prophylaxis, and facility factors, SSI was not associated with duration of prophylaxis. Adjusted odds of AKI increased with each additional day of prophylaxis (cardiac procedure: 24-{\textless}48 hours: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95{\%} CI, 0.95-1.12; 48-{\textless}72 hours: aOR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.39; ≥72 hours: aOR, 1.82; 95{\%} CI, 1.54-2.16; noncardiac procedure: 24-{\textless}48 hours: aOR, 1.31; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-1.42; 48-{\textless}72 hours: aOR, 1.72; 95{\%} CI, 1.47-2.01; ≥72 hours: aOR, 1.79; 95{\%} CI, 1.27-2.53). The risk of postoperative C difficile infection demonstrated a similar duration-dependent association (24-{\textless}48 hours: aOR 1.08; 95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.31; 48-{\textless}72 hours: aOR, 2.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.80-3.27; ≥72 hours: aOR, 3.65; 95{\%} CI, 2.40-5.53). The unadjusted numbers needed to harm for AKI after 24 to less than 48 hours, 48 to less than 72 hours, and 72 hours or more of postoperative prophylaxis were 9, 6, and 4, respectively; and 2000, 90, and 50 for C difficile infection, respectively. Vancomycin receipt was also a significant risk factor for AKI (cardiac procedure: aOR, 1.17; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-1.25; noncardiac procedure: aOR, 1.21; 95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.30). Conclusions and Relevance: Increasing duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis was associated with higher odds of AKI and C difficile infection in a duration-dependent fashion; extended duration did not lead to additional SSI reduction. These findings highlight the notion that every day matters and suggest that stewardship efforts to limit duration of prophylaxis have the potential to reduce adverse events without increasing SSI..},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although quality assessment is gaining increasing attention, there is still no consensus on how to define and grade postoperative complications. This shortcoming hampers comparison of outcome data among different centers and therapies and over time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A classification of complications published by one of the authors in 1992 was critically re-evaluated and modified to increase its accuracy and its acceptability in the surgical community. Modifications mainly focused on the manner of reporting life-threatening and permanently disabling complications. The new grading system still mostly relies on the therapy used to treat the complication. The classification was tested in a cohort of 6336 patients who underwent elective general surgery at our institution. The reproducibility and personal judgment of the classification were evaluated through an international survey with 2 questionnaires sent to 10 surgical centers worldwide. RESULTS: The new ranking system significantly correlated with complexity of surgery (P {\textless} 0.0001) as well as with the length of the hospital stay (P {\textless} 0.0001). A total of 144 surgeons from 10 different centers around the world and at different levels of training returned the survey. Ninety percent of the case presentations were correctly graded. The classification was considered to be simple (92{\%} of the respondents), reproducible (91{\%}), logical (92{\%}), useful (90{\%}), and comprehensive (89{\%}). The answers of both questionnaires were not dependent on the origin of the reply and the level of training of the surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: The new complication classification appears reliable and may represent a compelling tool for quality assessment in surgery in all parts of the world.},

Complex procedures and patients (eg, cancer, end-stage renal disease) and procedures with pre-existing infection were excluded. Surgical site infections within 90 days after cholecystectomy were identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent risk factors for SSI.Surgical site infections were identified after 472 of 66566 (0.71{\%}) cholecystectomies; incidence was higher after open (n = 51, 4.93{\%}) versus laparoscopic procedures (n = 421, 0.64{\%}; P {\textless} .001). Independent risk factors for SSI included male gender, preoperative chronic anemia, diabetes, drug abuse, malnutrition/weight loss, obesity, smoking-related diseases, previous Staphylococcus aureus infection, laparoscopic approach with acute cholecystitis/obstruction (hazards ratio [HR], 1.58; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.27–1.96), open approach with (HR, 4.29; 95{\%} CI, 2.45–7.52) or without acute cholecystitis/obstruction (HR, 4.04; 95{\%} CI, 1.96–8.34), conversion to open approach with (HR, 4.71; 95{\%} CI, 2.74–8.10) or without acute cholecystitis/obstruction (HR, 7.11; 95{\%} CI, 3.87–13.08), bile duct exploration, postoperative chronic anemia, and postoperative pneumonia or urinary tract infection.Acute cholecystitis or obstruction was associated with significantly increased risk of SSI with laparoscopic but not open cholecystectomy. The risk of SSI was similar for planned open and converted procedures. These findings suggest that stratification by operative factors is important when comparing SSI rates between facilities.},

We compared patients without bile spillage (bile spillage [-] group, n = 16) with patients who had bile spillage (bile spillage [1] group, n = 12). There was no statistical difference in stage between the groups. In the bile spillage (-) group, all patients underwent curative resection and there were two patients with locoregional recurrences and three patients with systemic recurrences. In the bile spillage (+) group, five patients underwent R1 resection and one patient underwent R2 resection and all eight recurrent patients had systemic recurrences. The disease-free survival and overall survival were shorter in the bile spillage (+) group (disease-free survival, 71.4 vs 20.9 months; P = 0.028; overall survival, 72.6 vs 25.8 months; P = 0.014).

abstract = {Background: Bile spillage (BS) occurs frequently during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, yet its impact on postoperative outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that BS increases the risk of surgical site infections (SSI) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Study Design: Patients older than 18, who were admitted to an academic hospital for a laparoscopic (or laparoscopic converted to open) cholecystectomy, from May 2010 to March 2017, were prospectively included. Open cholecystectomies were excluded. Patients were assessed clinically during hospitalization and 2 to 4 weeks after discharge. We compared those who had BS during the operation with those who did not. Our primary endpoint was the rate of SSI. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of SSI. Results: Of 1,001 patients, 49.9{\%} underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, 20.9{\%} for symptomatic cholelithiasis or biliary colic, 12.8{\%} for gallstone pancreatitis, and 16.4{\%} for other indications. Bile was spilled intraoperatively in 591 patients (59.0{\%}), with hydrops noted in 10.5{\%} and empyema in 14.6{\%} of them. In 202 (20.2{\%}) patients, BS was accompanied by stone spillage. Patients with BS were older (median age of 52 vs 42, p {\textless} 0.001) and were more frequently male (44.8{\%} vs 27.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Conversion to open was more likely in operations with BS (13.0{\%} vs 4.4{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Bile spillage was associated with a higher SSI rate (7.1{\%} vs 2.4{\%}, p = 0.001) and longer hospital stay (median of 3 vs 2 days, p {\textless} 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, BS, conversion to open, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score {\textgreater} 2 were independent predictors of SSI (odds ratios: 2.29, 2.46, and 2.1 respectively, p {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {Background: Patients can be symptomatic after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass because of either surgical complications or physiologic changes and adjustment to the new anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that could influence the rate of postoperative emergency room admissions (ERAs) and the clinical implication of these visits for patients who have undergone laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Methods: The medical records of patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity from 2001 to 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. The data of patients with a history of an ERA after surgery was compared with the data of patients without a history of ERAs. The data collected included demographics, weight, body mass index, operative time, and more. The ERAs were subdivided into early ERAs and late ERAs, and the data were analyzed further. Results: Of 733 patients, 228 (31.1{\%}) had a history of ERAs. Patients with early postoperative complication ({\textless}7 days after the procedure) had a greater rate of ERAs (60.9{\%} versus 30.1{\%}, P {\textless}.05). The operative time was significantly longer in the ERA group (91.4 versus 86.5 min). The most frequent complaint in the emergency room was abdominal pain (61.4{\%}) followed by vomiting (35.5{\%}). Gastric outlet obstruction was the most frequent cause of an ERA within 2 weeks after surgery. Most patients were treated conservatively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the rate of potential ERAs should not be disregarded. A prolonged operative time and early postoperative complications were significant predictors for late ERAs. Abdominal pain with or without vomiting was the most common presenting symptom. Most patients can be treated conservatively. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The studies that established historical rates of surgical infection after cholecystectomy predate the modern era of laparoscopy and routine prophylactic antibiotics. Newer studies have reported a much lower incidence of infections in "low-risk" elective, outpatient, laparoscopic cholecystectomies. We investigated the current rate of postoperative infections in these cases within a large, U.S. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Our primary outcome was postoperative surgical site infection; secondary was Clostridium difficile infection. Logistic models evaluated the associations of patient and operation characteristics with these outcomes. RESULTS: Surgical infection occurred in 1.0{\%} of cases (293/30,579). Cdifficile infection occurred in 0.1{\%} (31 cases). In our adjusted multivariable models, other/unknown race/ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, American Society of Anesthesiologists {\textgreater}2, operative minutes, and wound class 4 were associated with a significantly higher odds of surgical infection; no covariates were significantly associated with Cdifficile infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of modern U.S. surgical practice, the incidence of infection after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is very low, on par with clean cases. Our study identified several patient characteristics that were strongly associated with surgical infection. Many of these are not included as risk factors in current guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis and may help to identify those at higher risk for this rare complication.},
